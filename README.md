# Find FOSS / Anti–Big Tech Alternatives (Toolbox)

If you’re looking for good alternatives to Big Tech services (especially **FOSS**, **privacy-friendly**, and/or **EU-based** options), these directories and tools are a great starting point. Think: “like the CCC DI.DAY site”, but broader.

---

## 1) Migration guides (closest to CCC DI.DAY)
### **DI.DAY – Digital Independence Day (CCC)**
A collection of practical “switching recipes” (e.g., WhatsApp → Signal, Gmail → alternative mail providers, Chrome → Firefox, etc.).  
Use this if you want *step-by-step* “how to move” guidance.

---

## 2) EU-first alternatives (GDPR / Europe focus)
### **European Alternatives**
A large directory of **European** replacements for popular SaaS and consumer services.  
Great if your main priority is: *“Prefer EU-based vendors/services.”*

---

## 3) “Alternative to X” (privacy / ethics / FOSS-oriented)
### **switching.software**
Very beginner-friendly: pick a Big Tech product (Google/Facebook/Microsoft/Adobe…) and it suggests privacy-respecting alternatives.

### **Framasoft – De-google-ify Internet**
A well-known “service → alternative” map, especially focused on replacing Google-like services with more independent tools.

### **Privacy Guides**
Curated recommendations (password managers, DNS, browsers, messaging, mail, etc.) with a strong security + privacy focus, often with open-source options.

---

## 4) Android: find FOSS apps outside the Play Store
### **F-Droid**
The classic app catalog for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) on Android.

### **Neo Store**
A modern, faster, more comfortable **F-Droid client** (search + updates feel much nicer).

---

## 5) Bonus: ownership maps (“who owns what?”)
### **Digitalcourage – “Who owns what?”**
Helps you understand corporate structures and ownership (and often links to alternatives / self-defense resources).  
Useful if you want to avoid “Big Tech by proxy” (services owned by Big Tech subsidiaries).

---

## Quick workflow (recommended)
1. **Pick what you want to replace** (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive, WhatsApp, YouTube, Google Maps).
2. Check **DI.DAY** for migration steps if available.
3. Use **switching.software** + **Privacy Guides** to compare options (privacy/security).
4. Use **European Alternatives** if “EU-based” is a key requirement.
5. On Android: install via **F-Droid / Neo Store** when possible.

## If you want: I can make you a personal “switch plan”
Reply with 3–5 services/apps you want to replace and your priorities:
- **FOSS only** vs “open to non-FOSS”
- **EU-based preferred**?
- **Self-hosting okay**?
- **Ease of use** vs “maximum privacy”
