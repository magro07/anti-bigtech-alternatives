# debigtech-starter-kit
**Description:** A practical starter kit for replacing Big Tech: migration guides, alternative directories, and FOSS app sources.

---

## What this repo is
A small, curated toolbox to quickly find **FOSS**, **privacy-friendly**, and/or **EU-based** alternatives to popular Big Tech services.

Use it to:
- discover replacements for apps/services you use daily
- compare options (privacy, openness, EU-based hosting)
- get migration guides and practical “switching recipes”

## 5) Bonus: “Who owns what?” (avoid Big Tech by proxy)

## Recommended workflow
1. **List what you want to replace** (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive, WhatsApp, YouTube, Google Maps).
2. Check **DI.DAY** for migration steps if available.
3. Use **switching.software** + **Privacy Guides** to compare options (privacy/security).
4. Use **European Alternatives** if “EU-based” is a key requirement.
5. On Android: prefer **F-Droid / Neo Store** for installing FOSS apps.
